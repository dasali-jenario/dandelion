##Dandelion vs Wind##
Dandelion vs Wind is a simple, interactive game where two players, 'Dandelion' and 'Wind', take turns to fill a 5x5 grid.

*How to Play*
The game starts with the 'Dandelion' player's turn.
'Dandelion' can place a flower on any empty cell on the grid.
After 'Dandelion' places a flower, it's 'Wind's' turn.
'Wind' can choose a direction (up, down, left, or right) to spread seeds from each flower on the board to all empty cells in the chosen direction.
The game continues until all cells are filled with flowers or seeds, or until 7 rounds have been played.
If after 7 rounds not all fields of the grid are covered with flowers or seeds, the player 'Dandelion' wins.
